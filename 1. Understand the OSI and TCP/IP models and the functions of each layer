✅ OSI Model (7 Layers) – Brief Explanation

The OSI Model is a theoretical model that explains how data travels from one device to another through 7 layers.

1. Application Layer

Closest to the user.

Provides services like browser (HTTP), email (SMTP), file transfer (FTP).

Generates data for transmission.

2. Presentation Layer

Converts data into a format that both systems understand.

Handles: Encryption, Decryption, Compression, Encoding.

3. Session Layer

Manages sessions (connections) between devices.

Establishes, maintains, and ends communication sessions.

4. Transport Layer

Breaks data into segments.

Provides reliable communication using TCP or faster communication using UDP.

Does flow control and error control.

5. Network Layer

Handles IP addressing and routing.

Decides the best path for data to reach destination (routers work here).

6. Data Link Layer

Breaks packets into frames.

Uses MAC addresses.

Provides error detection for frame-level data.

Example: switches operate here.

7. Physical Layer

Transfers actual bits (0s and 1s) over cables or wireless signals.

Hardware: cables, hubs, electrical signals.

✅ TCP/IP Model (4 Layers) – Brief Explanation

The TCP/IP model is the practical model used in real-world networking (Internet).

1. Application Layer

Combines OSI layers 5, 6, and 7.

Provides application services:

HTTP / HTTPS

DNS

FTP

SMTP / POP3

Where the data starts.

2. Transport Layer

Uses TCP or UDP.

Responsible for:

Segmentation

Flow control

Error correction

Reliable or fast delivery

3. Internet Layer

Same as OSI Network Layer.

Responsible for:

IP addressing

Routing

Packet forwarding

4. Network Access Layer

Combines OSI layers 1 and 2.

Deals with:

MAC addresses

Physical transmission

Frames and bits
